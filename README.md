# UAPI
UAPI aims to unify the various Minecraft Modern server APIs, and allow plugin developers the opportunity to write once support all. This project is mostly for experimental purposes, but if it ends up getting some use, so be it.

#Feature Implementation
The various UAPI features will be implemented in a set order based on a determined priority set by the UAPI developers. This order is in an attempt to make UAPI more usable sooner.

Current feature being implemented: Event System

If you would like to provide help with implementing the event system please use https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1phlRmbPHCVhRIaZBi9xMjUuiDQkW-j8rSEV_tQnD47E/edit#gid=0 as a guide to Sponge Events and their Bukkit equivalents.

#Contribute
Any is free to contribute to UAPI via Pull Request. Code Style guidelines will be provided after the project reaches a more stable point, but for the most part use the current source as a guide.
